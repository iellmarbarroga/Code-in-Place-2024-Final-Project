Guessing game: Guess the color of the balls with the highest count


This is a guessing game where the user can initialize the number and size of the balls that would be bouncing around inside a canvas. The border of the canvas is color coded. When a ball hits a border, say the top border which has a color of green, the color of the ball would turn to green. As many balls keep bouncing around, changing colors all the time simultaneously, the user can watch the simulation and wait for the final count after 5 seconds (can be customized on the code). After that, the balls would be grouped and counted by the color. If the user guessed the color with the most count of balls, the user wins the guessing game.
